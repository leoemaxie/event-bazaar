# Ticket Marketplace 
Ticket Marketplace \(TM\) is an end-to-end blockchain based platform for the  booking, registration and resale of tickets between trustless parties. This will help to eliminate the current issue with fake tickets, uncontrolled resale price for the tickets in black market and monopoly caused as a result of centralization. The platform is built on the polygon blockchain network.

## 🦸 Blockchain To The Rescue
Through decentralization, monopoly by large ticket organization is broken therefore resulting in a decrease in price-fixing. Since smart contract once deployed are immutable and public, no individuals or organizations will have the power to reset ticket price and volume once it has been set.

## Getting Started
